my solutions and written tools for the hacker.org challenges

I started to solve the problems given on the painful outdated hacker.org board.
They are less challenging and therefore I decided to keep the repository public, but to add a spoiler alert.

**SPOILER:**

It is definitely more fun to find the solutions by yourself. Use search engines, math books and your brain.
The satisfaction archieved by biting through even challenging problems can't be reached by simply looking up a solution somewhere on the internet.
